## Project Description
In the fast-changing world of online shopping, our data whiz, Alex, embarked on an exciting journey. With Python and SQL as trusted companions, he explored a vast e-commerce dataset in three key phases: Data Cleanup, Cohort Analysis, and SQL Insights.

In the first phase, Data Cleanup with Python, Alex carefully combed through the dataset, fixing missing information and sorting out errors. He made sure the data was ready for the next steps.

The second phase, Cohort Analysis with Python, was where things got interesting. Alex grouped customers based on their shopping habits and timelines. This revealed secrets about customer loyalty and how people shop online, like deciphering a hidden code.

The final phase led Alex into the world of SQL Insights and Queries. Using SQL, he found answers to important questions. SQL helped Alex find these answers, giving us a full picture of e-commerce.

With each line of code and every SQL query, Alex didn't just find answers; he paved the way for smarter decisions. This project wasn't just about numbers; it was about helping e-commerce thrive in a competitive world.

Join us on this data-driven journey as we follow Alex's steps, revealing the secrets of online shopping success.
